# Forecasting & Analysis
## Overview
This repository combines forecasting models for SNAP EBT produce incentive programs with trend analysis of Double Up Food Bucks (DUFB) data across Texas sites. Together, these efforts provide actionable insights for grant planning, program sustainability, and community impact evaluation.
- **Forecasting:** Projects incentive redemption costs under $5 and $10 cap scenarios using store‑level produce sales and transaction data.
- **Analysis:** Explores SNAP and Double Up program trends from 2020–2025, highlighting variability, adoption patterns, and correlations across sites and organization types.
## Why This Matters
- **Grant Planning:** Transparent projections of program costs for funders and stakeholders.
- **Program Sustainability:** Scenario modeling ($5 vs. $10 caps) to balance reach and budget.
- **Community Impact:** Identifies high‑need areas and program adoption trends.
- **Strategic Decisions:** Correlation and trend analysis to optimize outreach and incentive design.
  ## Dataset Summaries
  - Store‑level produce sales and EBT transactions.
  - Key metrics: Avg monthly sales, transactions, incentive per transaction, monthly redemption, 3‑month and 7‑month projections.
  - Outputs: Comparative cost models for $10 vs. $5 incentive caps.
# Forecasting & Analysis Approach
## Forecasting Models
- **Sales Forecasting:** Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Arima, Prophet.
- **Redemption Cost Projections:** Scenario modeling for $5 and $10 caps, confidence bands for uncertainty.
- **Incentive Optimization:** Simulation models to balance participation vs. cost.
